# YOLO Playground
This is my playground to learn YOLOv8 about Computer Vision. Using `ultralytics`

### Current Progress
- [Object Detection](https://github.com/Rahuletto/yolo/blob/main/object_detect.ipynb)
- [Pose Detection](https://github.com/Rahuletto/yolo/blob/main/pose.ipynb)
- [Perimeter Alert](https://github.com/Rahuletto/yolo/blob/main/perimeter.ipynb)

### Interested?
You are free to check, use the code by yourselves and tune it as per your need. This is just my learning playground so don't expect for finest code.

### Wanna help?
Please. Create a PR or Issue if you know what you are doing. This will help me alot to learn about YOLOv8
